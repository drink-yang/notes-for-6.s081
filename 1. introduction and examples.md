# overview

## the purpose of an OS

1. Abstract the hardware for convenience and portbility;
2. Multiplex the hardware among many apps;
3. Isolation apps in order to contain bugs;
4. Allow sharing among cooperating apps;
5. Dont't get in the way of high performance;
6. Support a wide range of apps.

## Organization

-user apps : vim, gcc ......

-interfaces 

-kernel: FS, Mem access, processes

-hw: CPU, RAM, Disk, Net .....

```
* What services does an O/S kernel typically provide?
  * process (a running program)
  * memory allocation
  * file contents
  * file names, directories
  * access control (security)
  * many others: users, IPC, network, time, terminals
```

## app / kernel interface

"system calls"

Examples: 

```c++
fd = open("out",1);
write(fd,"hello\n",6);
pid=fork()
```

These looks like function calls, but actually jump into the kernel and execute system call implementation in the kernel.

## Examples

### copy.c

```c
// copy.c : copy input to output
#include "kernel/types.h"
#include "user/user.h"

int 
main() {
    char buf[64];
    while(1) {
        int n = read(0,buf,sizeof(buf));
        if(n<=0) break;
        write(1,buf,n);
    }
    exit(0);
}
```



If the 3rd argument is bigger than the buf size(like 65), then the operating system would just copy those 65 bytes to the memory of buf.

That is inviting a kernel to write junk to an unexpected place in your stack.

### open.c

```c
// open.c: create a file,write to it
#include "kernel/types.h"
#include "user/user.h"
#include "kernel/fcntl.h"

int
main() {
	int fd=open("output.txt",O_WRONLY|O_CREATE);
    write(fd,"ooo\n",4);
    
    exit(0);
}
```

The kernel remembers a table for every running process of index by file descriptors, and the table sort of tells the kerbel what each file descriptor refers to.

A critical point is that each process has its own sort of sapce of file descriptors.

### fork.c

```c
// fork.c: create a new process
#include "kernel/types.h"
#include "user/user.h"

int
main() {
    int pid;
    pid = fork();
    printf("fork() returned %d\n",pid);
    if(pid==0) {
        printf("child\n");
    } else {
        printf("parent\n");
    }
    exit(0);
}

```

The memory(not address) is same, and the file descriptor table is copid.

### exec.c

```c
// exec.c: replace a process with an execute file
#include "kernel/types.h"
#include "user/user.h"

int
main() {
    char *argv[]={"echo","this","is","echo",0};
    // 0 marks the end of the array.
    exec("echo",argv);

    printf("exec failed\n");
    exit(0);
}
```

The command exec would replace the calling process with the instructions read from a particular file you specify.

And loads the instructions from the file over the current process, and discarding its current memory.

Importantly, exec preserves the current table of file descriptors.

There's nothing for exec to return.(sometimes when exec occures some error,may return -1).

We  don't want commands(e.g. ls echo) to replace the shell. So what the shell actually does is fork and than the child calls exec.[**want to run program, but regian control**]

### forkexec.c

```c
// forkexec.c: fork then exec
#include "kernel/types.h"
#include "user/user.h"

int 
main() {
    int pid,status;
    pid=fork();
    if(pid==0){
        char* argv[]={"echo","THIS","IS","ECHO",0};
        exec("echo",argv);
        printf("exec failed\n");
        exit(1);
    } else {
        printf("parent waiting\n");
        wait(&status);
        printf("the child exited with status %d\n",status);
    }
    exit(0);
}
```

UNIX: if a program complete successfully exits with status 0.

### redirect.c

```c
// redirect.c: run a command with output redirected
#include "kernel/types.h"
#include "user/user.h"
#include "kernel/fcntl.h"
int 
main() {
    int pid;
    pid=fork();
    if(pid==0) {
        close(1);
        open("output.txt",O_WRONLY|O_CREATE);

        char* argv[]={"echo","this","is","redirect",0};
        exec("echo",argv);
        printf("exec failed\n");
        exit(1);
    } else {
        wait((int*)0);
    }
    exit(0);
}
```

This is idiom of forking and in child changing around the file descriptor.

In this program, we're redirecting just the output of echo command. And in child,

we close the file descriptor 1 since we want it to refer to something else(output.txt here).The semantics of open are that open returns the lowest file descriptor number.

why just redirect fd 1 of parent ? That is we still need the calling to do something else(just think parent is shell and the child is some commands).

echo knows nothing, it just writes its output to the file descriptor 1.

Only shell knows IO redirection.
